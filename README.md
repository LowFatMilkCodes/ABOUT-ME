üíª At the Current Time of writing this ( u can find when this was last updated on the bottom of the site :) ) 
I only know **PYTHON.**
I plan to learn more difficult languages soon. However I would prefer to **master them one by one**

to fully grasp every concept.

‚ùî To keep it simple I'm 16 years old and eager to learn.  
As much as I love to read and watch videos online that's not enough for me to fully learn to my highest abilities. I need **HANDS ON LEARNING.**  That's why I'm doing free jobs. **However**

If you would like to support me you can donate or pay for a job once its completed with a amount you see fit.

*Disclaimer: Any work/jobs that are done for free will be posted on my github as open source thank you for your understanding*

I have not setup a business email or other Social Medias just yet. 
The easiest ,and fastest way to contact me would be Discord.
